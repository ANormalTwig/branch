# Branch

An open source Community Place Bureau written in Rust, with support for Lua plugins!

Remember to never use a plugin from someone you don't trust, next to no sandboxing is done for the lua state so be careful.

See VSCP.md for more details!

# ToDo

- [x] Basic bureau implementation.
- [x] Fully implement ApplSpecific. (Probably correct.)
- [ ] Logging system.
- [x] Lua API (likely mlua or custom bindings).
- [x] WLS Implementation.
