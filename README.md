# Branch

Mostly functional Community Place Bureau written in Rust, with support for Lua plugins!

Remember to never use a plugin from someone you don't trust, next to no sandboxing is done for the lua state so be careful.

See VSCP.md for more details!

# ToDo

- [x] Basic bureau implementation.
- [ ] Fully implement ApplSpecific.
- [ ] Logging system.
