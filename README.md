An open source Community Place Bureau written in Rust, with support for Lua plugins!

Remember to never use a plugin from someone you don't trust, next to no sandboxing is done for the lua state so be careful.

See [LuaApi.md](/resources/LuaApi.md) for documentation of the lua api!

See [VSCP.md](/resources/VSCP.md) for details on the VSCP Protocol!
